# NPFTaint
NPFTaint is a static analysis-based tool for tracking sensitive data flows in binary programs, with a focus on the identification of network parsing functions and taint analysis. By combining decompilation techniques and data flow analysis, NPFTaint can efficiently trace sensitive data flows in binary programs and identify potential high-exploitable security vulnerabilities.
